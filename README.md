# How To:
  Fill in the weight of the other components you want on the ship.
  Fill in the tech level of the drive(s) you wish to calculate. Leaving a field empty calculates sizes without that drive,
    allowing you to calculate for whips with only one type of drive.
  Press "Calculate Weights" and presto! your output is on the left.

  This calculates in 50 ton increments, as per the game.
